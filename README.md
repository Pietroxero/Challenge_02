# <CSS Challenge - Professional Portfolio!>

## Description

For this weeks Challenge unlike the previous week we have not been given stater code to refactor and work with. Instead we are to build out own working portfolio from scratch using advanced elements of CSS. What will be applied in this page are the usage of flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

A Portfolio is used to showcase skills an talents to potential employers who are looking to fill a full/part-time role. This portfolio will aim to highlight my strongest work and the thought processes that went into their creation. 

The initial goal of this would be to have a few projects if not several that are deployed (live websites on the web) as a minimum requirement for a job interview.

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


## Body of Work

The intent for the works section squares is to have these be links to bodies of work that will be built and I would want to display for future potential employment. Ideally linking to things such as my github repo, or projects that are complete.


## Features

'Works' section involves a hover feature, with this feature when you hover over the images a text box with a description of the intended redirect will appear and the image will fade. 

## Tests

As part of the testing for this page, Multiple attempts were made to edit the CSS to have the functions for the 'Works' section. These test involved changing selectors little by little and using inspect dev tools on the webpage that was opened in a live server to see what these tweaks were changing and affecting.
